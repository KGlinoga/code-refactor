Code Refactor Challenge 1 HTML, CSS, and Git
The Code Refactor Challenge for the Horiseon landing page was meant to improve the state of the website's code in multiple areas.  We improved the codebase's accessibility both by adding alt text for every image and updating the HTML tags to fit Semantic HTML standards. We also ensured all links worked properly. 
This page is meant to introduce potential clients to the services that Horiseon can provide, which include SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.  We made it inviting by including bright, welcoming, and professional photos, and delivered information concisely with efficient copy.
